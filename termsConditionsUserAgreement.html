    <h2>1. Preliminary Provisions</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        <strong>1.1. Party Definitions.</strong> The Parties referred to in this Agreement are defined as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="subtext">
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.1.1. <strong>Company</strong> is the operator of the https://xhamster.com/ Website. “Company” has the
            meaning defined in this Agreement. When first-person pronouns are used in this Agreement, (Us, We, Our,
            Ours, etc.) these pronouns are referring to the Company and/or to any other sites that We may choose to
            operate in the future. Additionally, when the terms “the Site” or “Site” or the “Website” are used, these
            terms refer to https://xhamster.com/, any predecessor or successor domain or URL, along with any website
            published by Us, unless a site is specifically exempt from this Agreement. Our Site(s), and the services
            available to the Site and that the Site provides (“Services”), may contain images and videos (collectively
            referred to as the “Content”) and text, software, graphics, data, messages, or any other information, and
            any other website content owned, operated, licensed, or controlled by the Company (collectively referred to
            as the “Materials”).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.1.2. <strong>You, the User.</strong> As the User of this Site and/or Services, this Agreement will refer
            to the User as “You” or through any second-person pronouns, such as “Yours” etc. Hereinafter, the User of
            the Site and/or Services shall be referred to in applicable second-person pronouns. By using this Website,
            You certify that You are over eighteen (18) years of age or twenty-one (21) years of age, depending on the
            age of majority in Your jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.1.3. <strong>User vs. Member vs. Verified Member.</strong> For the purposes of this Agreement, all Members
            and/or Verified Members are Users, but not all Users are Members. This Agreement applies to all Users
            whether they are Members or not. You become a User by accessing this Site or the Services in any way,
            therefore You need not become a Member of the Site to have this Agreement applied to You. You are not
            considered a Member, as defined by this Agreement, until such time as You have submitted Your online account
            Registration (hereinafter “Registration”). You become a Member by registering with the Site for a User ID
            and password, as required by the Registration, as discussed below, or by enabling and registering with other
            available means of registration defined in Our Website. Registration is available without the provision of
            Your e-mail address. Also, registration is available via “Sign up with Google” function, that is available
            in the registration page of the Site. You are not considered a Verified Member, as defined by this
            Agreement, until such time as You have submitted Your online application to participate in Our Creators’
            Program (hereinafter “Verification”), subject to these Terms and the Creators’ Program Terms. You become a
            Verified Member once Your application has been reviewed by Us and Your online account has been accepted into
            the Creators’ Program.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        <strong>1.2. Electronic Signatures / Assent Required:</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="subtext">
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.2.1. Nobody is authorized to access the Site or use the Services, unless they have signed this Agreement.
            Such signature does not need to be a physical signature, since electronic acceptance of this Agreement is
            permitted by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act), Regulation (EU) No
            910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 and similar federal and state laws.
            YOU MANIFEST YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT BY TAKING ANY ACT DEMONSTRATING YOUR ASSENT
            THERETO. Most likely, You have clicked or will click a button containing the words “I agree”, “Sign Up” or
            some similar syntax or use “Sign up with Google” function in order to register on Our Website. YOU SHOULD
            UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HAS THE SAME LEGAL EFFECT AS YOU PLACING YOUR PHYSICAL SIGNATURE ON ANY OTHER LEGAL
            CONTRACT. If You click any link, button, or other device provided to You in any part of Our Site’s
            interface, then You have legally agreed to all of these Terms and Conditions. Additionally, by using any of
            Our Site or Services in any manner, including uploading Your Content to Our Site, You understand and agree
            that We will consider such use as Your affirmation of Your complete and unconditional acceptance to all of
            the terms in this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.2.2. If You fail to sign this Agreement, You understand that You are an unauthorized user of the Site and
            Services. No act or omission by Us should be interpreted as a waiver of the requirement that You assent to
            this Agreement. If You fail to do so, You are still bound by the terms of this Agreement by virtue of Your
            viewing of the Site or using any portion of the Site or Our Services.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        <strong>1.3.</strong> If You are seeking information regarding any illegal activities, You must leave this Site
        immediately and do not attempt to use the Services. You acknowledge that You are aware of the community
        standards in Your community, and You will only access the content on the Site and/or use the Services if You
        believe that the content on the Site does not offend the community standards prevalent in Your community.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        <strong>1.4.</strong> You agree not to use the Services or access the Site if doing so would violate the laws of
        Your state, province, or country.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        <strong>1.5. Revisions to this Agreement:</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="subtext">
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.5.1. From time to time, We may revise this Agreement. We reserve the right to do so, and You agree that We
            have this unilateral right. You agree that all modifications or changes to this Agreement are in force and
            enforceable immediately upon posting. Any updated or edited version supersedes any prior versions
            immediately upon posting, and the prior version is of no continuing legal effect unless the revised version
            specifically refers to the prior version and keeps the prior version or portions thereof in effect. If any
            amendment of this Agreement is deemed ineffective or invalid by any court, You and We (collectively, the
            “Parties”) agree that the prior, effective version of this Agreement will be considered valid and
            enforceable to the fullest extent permissible by law.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.5.2. We agree that if We change anything in this Agreement, We will change the “last modified” date at the
            top of this Agreement so that it is immediately apparent that We have updated the Agreement. The Agreement
            is located at
            <a class="link" href="https://xhamster.com/info/terms">https://xhamster.com/info/terms</a>
            and a link to the Agreement is also at the bottom of the home page of the Site under “Terms of use”. You
            agree to periodically re-visit this web page, and to use the “refresh” button on Your browser when doing so.
            You agree to note the date of the last revision to this Agreement. If the “Last Modified” date remains
            unchanged from the last time You reviewed this Agreement, then You may presume that nothing in the Agreement
            has been changed since the last time You read it. If the “Last Modified” date has changed, then You can be
            certain that something in the Agreement has been changed, and that You need to re-review it in order to
            determine how Your rights and responsibilities may have been affected by the revisions.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.5.3. <strong>Waiver.</strong> if You fail to periodically review this Agreement to determine if any of the
            terms have changed, You assume all responsibility for Your failure to do so and You agree that such failure
            amounts to Your affirmative waiver of Your right to review the amended terms and We shall not be held
            responsible. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        <strong>1.6. Incorporations by Reference.</strong> Although this Agreement represents the primary terms and
        conditions of service for Our Site, additional guidelines and rules are hereby incorporated by reference. The
        document(s) which can be found on Our Site, and which are specifically incorporated by reference, and are
        therefore part and parcel of this Agreement include the following:

            2.1.1. All Users may access certain public areas of the Site. You understand that all We are providing You
            is access to Our Services as We provide them from time to time. You need to provide Your own access to the
            Internet, and any Internet access or other fees that You incur to access Our Site and use Our Services are
            Your sole responsibility. We are not providing any hardware nor software to You – and You need to purchase
            or license the necessary hardware and software to access the Site and Services. This Agreement covers all
            public and non-public areas of the Site.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            2.1.2. By accessing the Site, You certify that:
        </p>
        <div class="subtext">
            <p class="paragraph">
                2.1.2.1. You are using the Site solely for personal, non-commercial purposes;
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                2.1.2.2. You will not copy or distribute any part of the Site without Our prior written authorization;
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                2.1.2.3. You will fully comply with these Terms and Conditions as well as Privacy Policy.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        <strong>2.2. Membership or User Account:</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="subtext">
        <p class="paragraph">
            2.2.1. Although a big part of the Site is available without creating an account, to access certain features
            of the Site and Services, You must either register as a Member of the Site or become a Verified Member.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            2.2.2. In connection with completing the Registration, You agree to provide true, accurate, current and
            complete information about Yourself as prompted by the Registration (such information being the
            “Registration Data”); and You further agree to maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it
            true, accurate, current and complete at all times while You are a Member or a Verified Member.
        </p>
        <div class="subtext">
            <p class="paragraph">
                2.2.2.1. As part of the Registration, You will be issued with or You may choose a unique username and
                password which You must enter in order to gain access to the non-public sections of the Site (for
                instance, to Your own account on the Site). You may also obtain access to the non-public sections of the
                Site if You registered on the Site via the “Sign up with Google” or “Sign up with Twitter” function. At
                the same time, under clause 1.1.3. of the Agreement, registration on the Site is available without the
                provision of an e-mail address, that is why We encourage You to remember Your username and password to
                be able to enter into Your account and to the non-public portions of the Site. If You want to be able to
                recover Your account, then You are strongly advised to provide Us with an e-mail address, which can be
                used for Your verification in case You either forget Your username or password, or You will want to
                deactivate Your account. You can provide an e-mail address either upon registration, or at a later stage
                through the “edit profile” section, available in the following link:
                <a class="link" href="https://xhamster.com/my/edit/profile">https://xhamster.com/my/edit/profile</a>.
                To recover Your password, You may use the dedicated page in Your account. However, if You do not provide
                Your e-mail address and You forget Your username or password, then We will be unable to confirm that
                such account is indeed Yours and thus You will be unable to recover access to Your account. What is
                more, if You do not provide an email upon registration or afterwards by editing Your profile, We will
                not be able to reactivate Your account in case You deactivate it.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                2.2.2.2. You certify that when asked to choose a username You will not choose a name which may falsely
                represent You as somebody else or a name which may otherwise be in violation of the rights of a third
                party. We reserve the right to change such username or delete the relevant account if it violates any of
                the aforementioned rights.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">
            2.2.3. <strong>Community User.</strong> Upon completing the Registration, You may choose to become a
            Community User by submitting a photographic image containing Your face and a handwritten text of Your
            username and “xHamster.com”. If You comply with requirements described herein, You will receive a special
            mark that confirms Your status as Community User.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            2.2.4. <strong>Verified Member.</strong> this option is available for all Members, and it is offered for the
            purpose of allowing Members to activate the Creators’ Program features, including but not limited to,
            uploading Content to the Site. Member’s verification means that such User’s documents (documents containing
            Your full legal name, picture, date of birth and other identifying features such as Your address) and data
            have been verified by a third-party service provider as engaged by Us from time to time. We do not accept
            any liability for the services provided by such third-party service provider. All data processing is done
            pursuant to Our Privacy Policy and the third-party service provider’s privacy policy. We may request
            additional documents from a Member for Verification to establish Your age and identity both prior and after
            the Verification, and We may also change the number of documents requested from Members from time to time at
            Our sole discretion. Types of documents accepted for Verification purposes are not the same for everyone and
            are set, between Us and the service provider, on a country basis and may include one or several of the
            following: national ID, national passport, international passport, citizenship card, state ID, driver’s
            license (only for countries where a national ID or passport is not mandatory). We reserve the right to
            review all and any verification results received from the service provider engaged at a time and render Our
            own final and binding decision as to the acceptance of data provided. However, should the Site verify the
            identity of a particular Member, such verification does not reflect or have any bearing on that Member's
            professional reputation or reliability as a proper business partner and, therefore, it should not be relied
            upon. Verified Members are in no way endorsed by the Site or its agents and have not been subjected to any
            screening process except as described above in this provision. Therefore, We specifically disclaim any and
            all liability associated with any communication, both online or offline, between any user and such Verified
            Member.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            2.2.5. Members are permitted to create one (1) account only.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            2.2.6. Membership may not be transferred or sold to a third party unless otherwise permitted by Us in
            writing.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            2.2.7. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on Your account, and You must keep Your
            account password secure. You must notify the Site immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use
            of Your account.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            2.2.8. In circumstances where any national or state law or any other jurisdiction implements a regulation
            that requires the age verification of Users, the Company may require the User to confirm their legal age.
            Such confirmation may be carried out with the assistance of third parties who provide verification services.
            By proceeding with such verification, the Member authorizes the Company to transfer their personal data to
            the third party for the purposes of confirming their legal age.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            2.2.9. User access to the Site is free of charge. We do not provide paid memberships of any kind. Any
            premium memberships or subscriptions made available via the Site are provided in part or entirely by third
            parties, regardless of any branding or names associated with such memberships. The Site is not responsible

        We reserve the right to terminate the Referral Program at any time and for any reason. The Program is
        administered by the Company, which may outsource certain elements of administration to third parties.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        These Terms are applicable to new Verified Members’ participation in the Referral Program. By participating in

        their entirety, then You cannot participate in the Referral Program.
    </p>

    <h2>1. SCOPE OF REFERRAL PROGRAM</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        1.1. The Referral Program shall apply to a Verified Member that decided to refer others to register on the Site,
        as Verified Members, (hereinafter, the “Referrer”) and to the person (natural person and/or legal entity) that
        is referred by the Referrer to the Site (hereinafter, the “Invited Member”).
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        1.2. The Referral Program provides each Referrer with the ability to earn rewards in case the following
        conditions are met:
    </p>
    <div class="subtext">
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.2.1. Referrer shall become a Verified Member as defined in General Terms and Conditions of the Site -
            https://xhamster.com/info/terms (the “General Terms”).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.2.2. After the Referrer’s successful and finalized registration as a Verified Member, the Referrer will
            receive a Referral Link (which is unique and personalized) via personal profile on the Site. Referral Link
            is a unique code that allows the Company to track that the Invited Member was invited by the Referrer.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.2.3. Referrer may share the Referral Link with any natural person or legal entity via any available
            sources of communication, e.g. via social media, e-mails, websites. Referrers must comply with all
            applicable laws and regulations and may not make any unlawful and/or unsolicited actions during the sharing
            of the Referral Link. The Referrer must comply with up-to-date electronic communication and direct marketing
            laws and regulations, which may include the laws of the jurisdiction where the intended Invited Member
            resides. Any distribution of the Referral Link that could constitute unsolicited commercial email or spam
            under any applicable law or regulation is expressly prohibited and will constitute grounds for immediate
            termination of Your account and exclusion from Referral Program. The Company reserves the right to
            automatically disqualify suspicious Referrals.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.2.4. The Invited Member shall only be a natural person or legal entity that is new on the Site and that
            has never been registered on the Site. The Referrer may not receive any income from the Invited Member that
            was registered as a Verified Member on the Site prior to receiving the Referral Link from the Referrer. The
            Referrer shall not receive any income from rejected or incomplete registration attempts by the Invited
            Member.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.2.5. The Invited Member shall register as a Verified Member in accordance with the General Terms via
            Referral Link of the Referrer. We shall not pay any reward to the Referrer if the registration as Verified
            Member of the Invited Member was made without the Referral Link. It is an obligation of the Referrer to
            provide the Invited Member with the Referral Link, and We bear no responsibility if the registration as
            Verified Member was made without such Referral Link.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.2.6. The Referrer may receive five percent (5%) of the total income, which the Invited Member will receive
            from the Company during the twelve (12) months after the registration as a Verified Member. The Company, at
            its sole discretion, reserves the right to define sources of income of the Invited Member that will count
            towards calculation of the Referrer's reward. The Company will place such sources and Referrer's reward on a
            special web page available for the Referrer.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            1.2.7. The duration of the Referral Program is twelve (12) months after the registration of the Invited
            Member as a Verified Member. The duration of the Referral Program starts from the date of the creation of
            the account by the Invited Member (not from the date of verification of this account, not from the upload
            date of its first uploaded video, etc.).
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        1.3. The Referrer may not earn more than $50,000 (Fifty Thousand US dollars) for one Invited Member for the
        whole duration of the Referral Program.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        1.4. To raise the possible reward of the Referrer, the Company may collaborate with third-party service
        providers. In such a case, if the Invited Member registers on the website(s) of third-party service providers,
        then the Invited Member’s latter registration will be automatically linked with the Referrer for the purpose of
        receiving an additional reward. In case that such interaction increases the income of the Invited Member, the
        Referrer will be awarded with an extra reward.<br>
        The following rules are applicable for the Referrer and for the Invited Member in connection with the said
        third-party service providers:
    </p>
    <div class="subtext">
        <p class="paragraph">
            — The duration of the Referral Program starts from the date of the creation of the account by the
            Invited Member on the Site or on the website(s) of the third-party service providers, depending on which
            action occurred first.<br>
        </p>
